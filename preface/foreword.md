# 1.0 Preface

## 1.1 Foreword

This book was originally created in October 2016 as I began to install and manage an ERPNext 7.0.x installation. The first thing that I noticed was a lack of good administration level technical knowledge for the care and feeding of the platform. The user manual has both technical and non-technical information in it and was confusing to users and technicians alike. This manual was created out of a need to aggregate knowledge from the forums, wiki's, online manuals and other sources into a single place to aid me in managing my self-hosted installation for my small business. The Administrators Guide started out as a LibreOffice Writer document maintained by me. As I became more involved with the ERPNext community and continued to see more and more requests to the forum for basic help I decided to turn the document into Markdown text and publish to the public here at GitHub.
